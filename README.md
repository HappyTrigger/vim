#Vim configuration

Working towards using vim as my main editor. Will hopefully update this repo continously with new plugins and keybind as I progress.

Will consider changing to nvim for plugins such as https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim etc, another possibility is to include config for nvim in this repo aswell.

Currently using vundle (https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as my plugin-manager.
